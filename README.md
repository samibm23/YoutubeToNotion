# YouTube Summarization with LLM and Notion Integration 

### Project Overview
With the help of Langchain and the Gemini model, this project pulls insights from YouTube videos and creates brief summaries. It incorporates the summaries into Notion via the Notion API, generating pages in the notion database.

The goal of the project is to improve knowledge management and cooperation in the Notion environment by collecting and summarizing YouTube material.



#### Notion Database

In this Notion database, you'll find the test cases I've created for this project.

[Notion Database](https://cyber-wire-b2a.notion.site/43efb2f1452d4483a0c9fd8e9705914b?v=f9cc26a08bdc4ea79d1fd544ff14c98f&pvs=4)
## Tech Stack
